    <h3 class="a">Title: The Terrible Numbers that Grow with Each Mass Shooting</h3>
    <h4 class="a">Authors: Bonnie Berkowitz, Denise Lu and Chris Alcantara</h4>
    <h4 class="a">Link: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.28a656bd2200">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.28a656bd2200</a></h4>
    <p class="pa">I met this article by accident when reviewing more news articles relevant to shooting, after being impressed by <a href="https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2010">the U.S gun killings data visualization.</a>This news was published in 2005 and still updated by the Washington Post until March, 2018. It reviewed at the 150 mass shootings in which four or more people were killed by one or two shooters from 1966 to Feb, 2018.</p>
    <p class="pa">This project have five sections of data visualization - deaths, guns, shooters, shooting timeline, and places across the US. They altogether documented the 150 mass shootings in terms of victims (age, race, and gender), guns (types, and sources), shooters (age, race, gender, and ending), shootings (timelines), and places (locations, and states) in detail.</p>
    <h3 class="a">Pros</h3>
    <h3 class="a">A. Interactivity Design</h3>
    <p class="pa">This project converted the historical and real-time shooting text information into interactive graphs well. For each section, listing people or gun icons to denote the victim deaths or gun tools shows their severe impacts from these shooting incidents. By choosing a particular shooting incident in the search bar, the corresponding icons for this event are highlighted among all the incidents in the five sections. This interactive design using highlighting among the rest incidents, instead of only showing the searched incident, provides a visual impact of the shooting consequences. When hovering on one victim or gun icon, the rest of victims or guns involved in the same incidents is highlighted and the incident details are summarized in the pop-up boxes. This interactive design provided a full storytelling of shooting incidents for the users, which allows the "most interested users to dig deep" case by case and helps to " build trust in the data" (Gregor Aisch, 2017,In Defense of Interactive Graphics)</p>

    <h3 class="a">B. Visualization Layout</h3>
    <p class="pa">This project keeps a great balance between narrative telling and data visualization. Below the huge title, an amination of victim icons for different shootings and their descriptive sentence, in the same style with those of the main sections, offers a concretized illustration tightly after the title. Before going into the five sections of icon-oriented visualization, a few well-written paragraphs introduce the background of mass shootings. It is a great example of "onboarding", which is "what happens in the first moments after a person opens your app or website or even newspaper page". This shapes "the rest of people's experience" with the project (Dominikus Baur, 2017, The death of interactive infographics?).</p>
    <img src="../../img/a8/2.png" alt="Hello World!">
    <p class="pa">In addition, one or two concise introduction paragraphs of victims, guns, and shooters in the special cases (the oldest/ youngest victim, Semiautomatic rifles/pistols/, Women/Middle-schoolers) are embedded in each section.  This highlights the important findings of the shooting cases and prevents single and boring exploration among a pool of icons.</p>
    <img src="../../img/a8/3.png" alt="Hello World!">
    <h3 class="a">C. Data Humanism</h3>
    <p class="pa">This project emphasizes the personalized attitudes toward shootings when demonstrating the shooting cases. “In its second wave, data visualization will inevitably be all about personalization”. That is to “connect numbers to what they really stand for: knowledge, behaviors, people” (giorgia lupi, 2017, Data Humanism, the Revolution will be Visualized). For example, the dark gray and light yellow is applied to the children and teenager deaths, the weapons legally/illegally obtained, the shooters died at or near the scene of the shooting. This emphasis implies the strong negative attitude of this project toward the shooting incidents. </p>

    <h3 class="a">Cons</h3>
    <h3 class="a">A. Data Limitation</h3>
    <p class="pa">The whole project is built on the definition of mass shooting. In this project, the team cites the Reddit definition of mass shooting, which looks at the mass shootings in which four or more people were killed by one or two shooters. However, the audience of this article is the general journalism readers. As discussed in this article (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonkblog/mass-shooting-definition/">The number of 'mass shootings' in the U.S. depends on how you count</a>), different people have their own thoughts on mass shooting. It is clear that this project explained the mass shooting definition at its “onboarding” section. However, including a larger shooting database might allow the users to extract the shooting cases under their own definition.</p>

    <h3 class="a">B. Visualization Design</h3>
    <p class="pa">There is no deny that listing the icons one by one narrates the story clearly and effectively. However, some details could be perfected in terms of icondesigns. The victim icons outline different people characteristics including gender and age. Some icons do not denote or classify the victims consistently in terms of characteristics. For instance, the different age for these icons is vague. Additionally, a legend of victim icons might contribute to a clear understanding of these icons.</p>
    <img src="../../img/a8/5.png" alt="Hello World!">
    <p class="pa">This design team separates the victim icons in the same incident. They are not arranged by the order of time and age. It is hard to understand the intention behind this design. The color for this design is light grey, dark grey, light yellow, and purple. I personally recommend to change purple for selected icons to red aligning with the meaning of bloody shootings.</p>
    <img src="../../img/a8/6.png" alt="Hello World!">

    <h3 class="a">Case comparison</h3>
    <p class="pa">"The tradition of critique by redesign is, if anything, growing in popularity" (Fernanda and Martin, 2015, Design and Redesign in Data Visualization). However, due to the limitation of time, a complete redesign is infeasible. A comparison between this project and another project in the same topic - U.S gun killings project, might be helpful to explore the design boundary of this project.</p>

    <p class="pa">Both projects attempt to project the gunshot deaths (race, gender, and age), weapons (types), and geography at the individual incident level. Different from the storytelling perspectives of mass shootings project, the U.S. gun killings project aims at the abstract representation of gun deaths in 2010 and 2013. Compared to the gun killings project, the mass shootings project allows for more deeper insights into the shooting cases by selecting the cases or icons one by one. However, the gun killings project can inspire some redesign possibility for the mass shootings project. First, it could include more sections relevant to shootings, such as the relationships between the shooters and victims. Second, the gun killings project presents victim deaths with the prediction of their life span if they are alive. It might be interesting to explore this design thinking in the mass shootings project, which will emphasize the destructive impacts of shootings.</p>
    <h3 class="a">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="pa">"More important, from the perspective of journalism, is that data visualization is an essential part of the communication process". (Fernanda and Martin, 2015, Design and Redesign in Data Visualization) In general, this project achieves what it aimes - to tell the story behind the shooting numbers, and to communicate with its general public audience.
